Aston Martin Vanquish,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_Vanquish_(2012),"The 2012 Aston Martin Vanquish was the second generation of the Vanquish, a grand touring car. It was produced between 2012 and 2018 by the British carmaker Aston Martin. It succeeded the DBS, resurrected the name of the 2001–2007 model, and was available as both a coupe and a convertible, the latter known as the Volante. The Vanquish, which is based upon the DB9's architecture, extensively incorporates aluminium throughout its construction. The Vanquish was designed by Marek Reichman and showcased at several events in 2012. It was produced in Gaydon, a village in Warwickshire, England. Aston Martin unveiled the Vanquish Volante in August 2013 and began deliveries late that year. In 2014, they implemented minor modifications to the Vanquish's engine performance. A significantly modified version, the Vanquish S, was launched in 2016; its Volante version was released the following year. The Vanquish S introduced such updates as increased horsepower and torque, and a new body kit. (Full article...)",Featured,,2025-04-02 18:20:03

"Bragg House (Camden, Arkansas)","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_House_(Camden,_Arkansas)","The Bragg House is a historic house in rural Ouachita County, Arkansas. It is a two-story Greek Revival house located about 4 miles (6.4 km) west of Camden, the county seat, on United States Route 278 (formerly designated Arkansas Highway 4). The house is basically rectangular in plan, with a hip roof. Its main entrance is sheltered by a two-story temple-style portico, with four columns topped with Doric capitals, and a turned-baluster railing on the second floor. Peter Newport Bragg began construction of the house in 1842, but did not complete it until 1850. The house was built out of virgin lumber sawn on Bragg's sawmill by his slaves; it remains in the hands of Bragg's descendants.[2]","Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas|Houses completed in 1850|Houses in Ouachita County, Arkansas|National Register of Historic Places in Ouachita County, Arkansas|1850 establishments in Arkansas|Southwest Arkansas Registered Historic Place stubs",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Bragg_House.jpg/250px-Bragg_House.jpg,2025-04-02 18:20:23
